Welcome my dear code diver! This is the main file of the glorious thing called MicrOS Navigation Utility or MNU!
This is my attempt at making a file explorer for the incredible, best that exists os, that is called MicrOS
This is also a rewrite of the first, inferior version of this program, started on november 4'th 2022, enjoy(?) my best code up to date!

1. Common variables

    char* path_main - used as a container for the current dir path, at first taken from argv[1]

    unsigned short int n, m, k - my favourite iteration variable names and type, unsigned short int should be enough for anything in MicrOS, 
        sometimes unsigned int instead

    mnu_filesystem_navigation_struct navigation_info - navigation struct (in structures) common name used in code, declared in loop main function

2. Structures

Their related function info can be seen in their respective "..._functions.h" files
It's better to include the function files as they already have the struct defined and there's a constructor, which is usually needed anyways, in these files
Function files contain all the needed free functions so just use them to do that after ending the program

    mnu_filesystem_navigation_struct - always to be declared with mnu_filesystem_navigation_struct_constructor(), contains all basic data used for file exploring

    mnu_filesystem_file_list_struct - always to be declared with mnu_filesystem_file_list_struct_constructor(), contains list of files, their names

3. Chart
Not all functions are here, only the most important ones to help understand the project
                main() ------------------------------------------------------> mnu_run_main_loop
(basic startup and path_main creation)                    (main loop, key reactions, redirection to proper subfunctions)
                                                                                      |
                                                                                    switch
                                                                                      |
                                               mnu_draw_help_screen <-----------------|
                                                                                      |
                                                                                     \/
                                                                            mnu_draw_file_explorer






4. Stages

Stages are used to differ between different things that are happening and are used in a main switch in loop.c file to use respective functions
They are named using the mnu_main_loop_stage enum from it's file with similar name

5. Other

The project will be separated into sections with different focuses. As of now there's only the filesystem one, concerned with file exploration,
changing them, etc. In the future I also plan launching other programs, opening files,etc, in other sections.

Functions used only within 1 .c file and not declared int he header have the local_ prefix.
